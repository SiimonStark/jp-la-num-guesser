## Project title
Number Guesser Game by Liz Asbell (https://github.com/easbell) & Justin Pyktel

## Motivation
Our first group project, where we were put to the test!! We had to learn a lot of the code either on our own or we had to ask for tips and assistance from our peers with more experience. I would say that the experience we gained in completing this project has certainly given us a much more thorough understand of using foundational Javascrcipt concepts (such as: manipulating the DOM, using buttons and forms with logic tied in, and creating entire HTML models in JS).

## Build status

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript</b>

## Features
In the game there are two players in which they must try and guess a randomized number within the given/inputed range field.
  -Once a winner is decided, their name will appear in an overflow: scroll container.
  -The numbers in the range must meet the criteria of only being a number and for the min to be less than the max range.
    -The numbers guessed by the user must be only numbers and within the range that was determined by the range function.
   -There is an area below the submition form that keeps track of current guesses and will display if the guess was too high/low.

## Challenges/Wins
Many challenges!!: Diving right into javascript was a headache, but felt the most rewarding once things started to click and our understanding of the overall concept starting coming to light. We would have liked to increase and decrease the intervals of the min/max range each time a winner was decided, however we did not make it that far at the time of submission.

Biggest win: Figuring out each new function was extremely satisfying. Overall I believe our project to be well polished in design and functionality. I know that our code could definitely be refactored and improved, but I'm proud of our accomplishments. JavaScript is new to both of us, so we experienced a huge learning curve through the duration of the project. We accomplished more than we had initially anticipated, which leaves us feel great about our finished submission.

## How to use?
  1. Enter a min and max range in the number fields.
  2. Click the UPDATE button.
  3. Enter both player's name in the text fields (if no input, it will display an error message)
  4. Enter both player's guesses in their corresponding fields.
  5. Click the SUBMIT button.
  6. Review the current guess details below, to get an understanding of whether your guess was too high/low.
  7. Once a player successfully guesses the randomly generated number, their name will displayed in GLORY in the winner's card section.
  8. You can then either clear the guesses using the CLEAR button. 
    - Or you can reset the guesses and names using the RESET button.
  9. HAVE FUN!!

## Credits
Big thank you Liz Asbell! You were a wonderful partner and I learned a tremendous amount by your side. Bouncing ideas off one another and figuring out a solution together was such a great learning experience. I couldn't have asked for a better first partner!

Also thank you to everyone who donated their time and patience to our success. Turing truly is a great environment to start this journey into our tech careers! The ecosystem of other developers all struggling and learning together builds such a strong emphasis on helping others and yourself to achieve success!!!
